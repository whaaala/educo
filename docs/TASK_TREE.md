# The task tree

Everything any session has said it will do, as ONE tree — so moving between sessions and contexts loses nothing.
**Read it at the start of every session. Update it in the same change as the work, and before the session ends.**

## How to use it

- **Find "YOU ARE HERE"** — the one branch being worked on. Work in progress is one branch (RULE RK).
- **A promise goes in the tree the moment it is made** ("I will…", "next…", "after this…"), under its parent, with the
  date and where it was said. A task nobody wrote down is a task that is lost at the next session.
- **Nothing is deleted.** A finished branch is marked done with its commit or measurement; a dropped one is marked
  dropped with who decided and why.
- **A branch closes only when all its children are closed**, or the user has decided otherwise.
- **The bug ledger is a branch**, not a separate list: each open class hangs under the work that found it.
- **"New session" is the signal.** The moment the user says it, the session writes its entry in the **Session log** at
  the bottom — started from, got to, continue from — moves YOU ARE HERE, and commits. Before anything else.
- **It reminds the user too.** Every session opens by saying where we were and what is still open, and asks: continue
  there, or leave it? A branch is only left on the user's word, and the tree says so.

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[x]` | Done — with the commit, test or measurement that shows it |
| `[>]` | In progress — **YOU ARE HERE** marks the exact leaf |
| `[ ]` | Not started |
| `[?]` | Needs the user's decision — never decided alone |
| `[~]` | Parked or dropped — with who decided, and why |
| `[!]` | Status not verified — check before relying on it |

Last updated: **2026-09-29**, session df7557b5, branch `builder/layout-uat`.

---

## 1 · Website builder (current focus — first product to release)

### 1.1 · The four tasks (the user's handoff note, 2026-09-26) — see memory `project_four_tasks.md`

- `[>]` **1.1.1 · TASK 1 — the layout** (grew from "width round trips"; branch `builder/layout-uat`)
  - `[x]` Width round trips in stored percentages — `2de0ef2`
  - `[x]` Semantic pages, real-screen editing, resize that comes home — `5345e80`
  - `[x]` Link blocks, band colour schemes, dressed pages (RULE E) — `c3e99cf`
  - `[x]` The four layout decisions 1D · 2A · 3A · 4A — `919d731`
  - `[x]` **Tier 80 dressed sweep** — 70 pages, fixes in `67f7f64`
    - `[ ]` page 38 "could not select" the 2nd of 4 card columns (same class as 1.1.1.c-11 below)
  - `[>]` **Tier 95 dressed sweep** — 135 pages swept, fixes in `919d731`
    - `[ ]` The 19 build failures re-run (could-not-select ×9 · drop-offered-nothing ×7 · barely visible ×1 · click
      timeout ×2) — same classes as tier 99, fixed there first
  - `[>]` **Tier 99 dressed sweep** — 403 pages in 688 min, 52 could not be built, 17 clean (2026-09-29)
    - `[x]` a · The log copied out of Temp → `scripts/uat/logs/sweep99.log`; baseline results kept in
      `scripts/uat/dressed99-baseline-out`
    - `[x]` b · Uncommitted work secured — gate green, `bc89d68` pushed
    - `[>]` c · **Triage and fix, class by class (the bug ledger of this sweep)** — counts are pages affected
      - `[x]` c-1 · **Icon taller in the Preview than on the canvas** (#143) — 185 pages, +18px phone … +6px wide.
        ROOT CAUSE: `isEmptyBox` counted a block that draws its own content (Icon, List, Divider) as an empty box, so
        it got the 2.5rem floor; the canvas then discarded the floor's height and the export kept it (7 of 11 block
        types disagreed). Fixed in `isEmptyBox` + `childStyle` + the canvas wrapper; guard enumerates every block type,
        mutation-proven ×3. HEADED UAT probe-t7 on build DM9hSozR: identical at all five rungs; sweep pages 21, 139, 86,
        63, 10 re-run headed: 5 errors → 0 each
      - `[x]` c-2 · **List shorter in the Preview** (#135) — 145 pages, −8 … −17px. Root cause: the canvas spaced its
        items, the export did not. Fixed with one shared `LIST_ITEM_GAP`, guard mutation-proven. HEADED UAT probe-t7 on
        build DM9hSozR: identical at all five rungs (80.4 · 82.6 · 84.9 · 95.7 · 117.6px); same five pages at 0 errors
      - `[ ]` c-3 · **Heading / text wraps differently in the Preview** — 77 pages at Tablet 768 (+33 / +50px), 28 at
        Desktop. #137 (page as a size container) is in `bc89d68`. Pages 139, 63, 10 carried it and are at 0 errors on
        the fresh build; the full re-run (d) closes it or reopens it
      - `[x]` c-4 · **Build failed: could not select a column** — 36 pages (incl. page 199). HARNESS. Measured on all 36:
        the click selected an ANCESTOR every time (its grid ×21, a stack ×13, nothing ×2). Logged click by click on
        pages 298, 37, 122: each click goes one box deeper, the column is SEVEN boxes down on a sidebar page, and the
        harness stopped at six. It clicks until it is there now (up to 16). Pages 298, 37, 122, 199, 266, 185 re-run
        headed: all six build, all six at 0 errors
        - `[x]` the harness's "come back" misfired once it existed: dragging back cannot restore a row whose neighbour
          dropped (page 33: a cell left 41px wide). It UNDOES the drag and tries one step less now
      - `[x]` c-5 · **Build failed: the canvas offered the drop and added nothing** — 15 pages (9 "under", 6 "into"),
        every one right after the hero. Screenshot p33-build-fail.png read: the first section's heading and text sit
        under it (the section has no background of its own, so it reads as one band with the header). The tree is right;
        the drop under the text was offered and added nothing. The selected heading's floating toolbar sits over that
        text. CONFIRMED through the UI (probe-t9): released on the toolbar, nothing is added (3 of 3); beside it, the
        block is (2 of 2). FIXED: while anything is dragged over the window the selection chrome lets the pointer
        through (`body[data-box-drag-in]`). Browser guard with a REAL pointer drag onto every control of the toolbar,
        red on the old build; HEADED UAT probe-t9 on build TylJ2DR6: 5 of 5 added, screenshot read.
        - `[x]` pages 219 and 249 failed for a SECOND cause, the harness's: they ask for a grid of 5 across and the
          picker offers 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 6 · 12 — it found no square, clicked nothing, and the picker sat open. It takes
          the next size up and deletes a cell now, and says so under GAPS. Pages 33, 163, 219, 249 re-run headed: all
          four BUILD; 33 and 163 at 0 errors, 219 and 249 at 1 each (canvas≠Preview at Wide, to look at)
        - `[?]` GAP, the user's decision: **a grid of five across cannot be chosen** (nor 5, 7, 8… — only what
          twelve divides into). A leave, take six and delete one · B let the picker offer any count up to 12 (a grid
          already stores its own column count)
      - `[x]` c-20 · **The toolbar kept the side it chose when the block was selected** — dock the blocks panel and the
        page is refitted to 77%, the block moves to within 36px of the top, and the bar stayed ABOVE it, over the top
        edge of the page. It re-measures on `transitionend` now. Browser guard, red on the old build, green on TylJ2DR6
      - `[?]` c-21 · **The right-edge handle covers the last letter of a selected block that hugs its words** ("What we
        offe", probe-t9 screenshots). The handles are centred ON the edge, so half of each lies inside the block. The
        user's decision — it moves every handle: A leave · B draw the edge handles outside the block · C fade a handle
        that lies over words. Recommended: B
      - `[ ]` c-6 · **Build failed: timeout** — 1 page (+2 click timeouts that also could not select)
      - `[x]` c-7 · **HOLE at the end of a line at canvas Wide 1920** — 29 pages, 44 findings. Every such row stores
        widths summing over 100% (50 + 25 + 33.34). MEASURED (page 101 with step logging, probe-t8 --row --main=62):
        three columns need 3 × 14rem = 672px; in a 668px main column the third had ALREADY dropped to the next line when
        the dresser sized the first two. Dragging itself is sound — every probe on one line stores 100%.
        - `[x]` HARNESS: `sizeColumns` checks the whole line; a row that is not on one line is sized at the Desktop
          (then Wide) screen size, as a person would, and the count is in the report (`SIZING:`); a row no screen size
          holds on one line is left as dropped and listed under `GAPS`. Pages 6, 74, 101, 186, 36 re-run headed: 0 errors
        - `[x]` page 64 had c-8's cause (a Quote in a 111px column); 0 errors after the dresser's width-first change
        - `[?]` ENGINE, the user's decision: a person who DOES size two columns while the third is on the next line
          gets 50 + 25 + 33.34, and a hole on every wider screen. A keep as is (the size you drag is the size you get,
          and an unsized column keeps the share it was dropped with) · B a column nobody has sized by hand takes what
          is left of its line · C the editor warns when a line adds up to more than 100%. Recommended: B
      - `[ ]` c-8 · **Words broken across lines in the Preview** — 23 pages, 905 instances, column width median 77px.
        Text placed in a column narrower than its longest word ("1,000+", "everything", "description"). Measured:
        a Card in a grid cell 2 columns of 12 wide, inside a 70% main column (119px). Two halves:
        - `[x]` HARNESS: the dresser picked a column's content by its SHARE (< 12% → an Icon); it picks by the WIDTH the
          column has at 900px now (`fitTile`: under 6rem an Icon, under 150px words instead of a Card / Quote / Stat),
          and sets the section's width BEFORE filling it. Pages 148, 150, 159 re-run headed: 40, 18, 32 errors → 0.
          After the width-first change page 64 is at 0 errors; page 211 still breaks "1,000+" in a Stat at 900px
          (120px columns; the estimate said 150): the floor is 190px now, carrying that fifth. Page 211 re-run: 0 errors
        - `[?]` ENGINE, the user's decision: what a grid does when words are put in a cell narrower than the longest
          word — A break the word (today) · B narrow the grid by its narrowest cell that holds words · C leave it
          and have the Page check say so. (A row column is already never narrower than its longest word.)
      - `[x]` c-9 · **Image runs off the page by 1px** (#142) — 12 pages at 600–899px. Right edge lands at 769 on a
        768 page: decision 1D's −0.0625rem slack on the last column (1px, 1.5px at 150% text) plus sub-pixel rounding.
        The page does not scroll sideways (L1 is clean on all 12). NOT A BUG in the engine (measured: 1–2px on every one
        of the 12); the audit allows the slack + half a pixel now. Pages 24 and 290 re-run headed: 0 errors
      - `[x]` c-10 · **150% text: an Icon spills out of a 50–55px column and overlaps** — 9 pages spill, 5 overlap.
        Same root as c-1 (the floor's 2.5rem minimum width is 60px at 150%). Pages 119, 285, 378, 328, 254 re-run
        headed: no spill and no overlap left
      - `[ ]` c-11 · **Tablet: 4 columns on one line** (L6, #78) — 3 pages
      - `[ ]` c-12 · **React error #185** (max update depth, #134) — 2 pages (idx 34, 43)
      - `[x]` c-15 · **Selection handles stay at the previous screen size** — the page frame changes width by a 300ms
        transition with no render, so the handles were never re-measured (97…1107 around a block at 415…790). The
        mirror now follows `transitionrun` / `transitionend` of anything that holds the block. Guard in
        `chrome-follows-resize.spec.ts` (8 changes of size in a row): red on the old build (225px off), green on
        fxuGzvaE. HEADED UAT probe-t8, canvas-768 and canvas-375 read: handles on the block
      - `[x]` c-16 · NOT A BUG — the two purple bars in Preview are the Preview's OWN width grips
        (`app/website/box-demo/page.tsx` 992–998: `h-10 w-1.5 rounded-full bg-indigo-500/70`), and the canvas with
        its selection chrome is unmounted while Preview is open (`if (preview) return …`)
      - `[x]` c-17 · **A narrowed grid had a row more in the editor than on the page** — the editor's "Add a block
        here" offer took a cell of its own (Tablet: 3 rows of 116px drawn, 2 of 174px published). THREE causes, each
        found by re-running: (1) the offer ignored a grid narrowed by its OWN BOX → hidden inside the container query;
        (2) it counted `used % track`, as if cells packed tightly → `gridLeftoverAt` walks the rows; (3) it counted
        unstretched spans → counts `gridSpanAt`, the spans drawn. Unit guard (10 arrangements × rungs) and browser guard
        (1·3·8, 1·11, 11·1 × 4 sizes), each red before its fix. HEADED UAT probe-t8 on build hQOBKlr1: identical at all
        five rungs; sweep pages 285, 119, 378, 328 re-run headed: 0 errors
      - `[x]` c-19 · HARNESS: **the dresser drags past what the neighbour can give, then clicks the editor's offer.**
        In a narrow grid one column is under the 3rem hand floor, so the neighbour keeps its 6 columns and drops a row
        (stored 11 + 6, page 254); the free half-row offers "Add a block here" under the pointer and the next click
        meant to SELECT adds an empty cell (7 of 777 grids in the baseline). `sizeColumns` now looks, and brings the
        edge back until the neighbour is beside it again (counted per page as `cameBack`); `select` moves the pointer
        first and never clicks the offer. Page 254 re-run headed: 0 errors, the dresser came back 6 times, no stray
        cell in any of 13 grids
      - `[x]` c-18 · HARNESS: the sweep compared a 720px editor window with a 900px Preview window, so a row beside
        a sticky sidebar (one screen tall by design, `100dvh`) read as canvas≠Preview on every block (page 141).
        The rungs are compared in windows of the same height now; page 141 re-run headed: 4 errors → 0
      - `[x]` c-13 · Sweep header said "tier ≤ 80%" on a tier-99 run — names the plan now (`uat-pages.js`)
      - `[x]` c-14 · Two unit guards were wrong about what ships (base budget counted comments; scaffolding guard
        forbade the page's own size container) — both measure the shipped sheet now, mutation-proven, `bc89d68`
    - `[>]` d · **The whole tier re-run on the fixed build** — 39 affected pages re-run headed first, 35 of them at 0
      errors. The full run (403 pages, about 11.5 hours, no tokens spent) was STARTED 2026-09-29 on build wg5lR_xU:
      log `scripts/uat/logs/sweep99-rerun.log`, results `scripts/uat/dressed99-out`, the first run kept in
      `scripts/uat/dressed99-baseline-out`. **DO NOT edit `scripts/uat/*.js` while it runs.** When the log ends with
      "403 pages in N min": `node scripts/uat/triage.js scripts/uat/dressed99-out` and
      `node scripts/uat/triage-r11.js scripts/uat/dressed99-out`, compare with the baseline (17 clean, 52 not built),
      and put every class into this ledger **← YOU ARE HERE**
  - `[ ]` **RULE AF harness additions** (promised 2026-09-28)
    - `[ ]` Page-weight audit in every page report (HTML+CSS+JS ≤ 100 KB compressed · first view ≤ 500 KB at 360px ·
      images sized and lazy · ≤ 2 font families)
    - `[ ]` Slow-3G profile in the sweep and in `test:fast` (first band within 5 s)
  - `[ ]` **The innovative plan** — `--plan=dressedinnovative`, 19 pages
  - `[ ]` **Open engine lines carried from earlier sessions**
    - `[ ]` #144 `capturesFixed` / `fixedBlockedBy` still assume a size container captures a fixed block (false in
      Chromium 145; check Safari 16 before removing the canvas mirror)
    - `[ ]` #127b the stat number "1,000+" breaks in a 10% column (joins c-8)
    - `[ ]` #82b · #83 (1366 width round trips drift) · #84 (left-edge resize uses a fixed 14rem neighbour floor)
    - `[ ]` previewcheck B30 / P4 (harness: drop / select)
    - `[?]` #46 and #42 — could not be identified anywhere; ask the user what they were
    - `[!]` the slide-image check (Sonnet) — named in the 2026-09-28 handover, status unknown
  - `[ ]` **Story additions** in `docs/guide/layout-story.md` for everything above (RULE L)
  - `[ ]` Artifacts and guide updated in the same change (Builder Hub · Layout System · Parity Audit · Semantic plan ·
    `docs/guide/website-builder.md`)
  - `[ ]` Gate → commit → **pull request to `master`** → delete the branch (rule 9)
- `[ ]` **1.1.2 · TASK 2 — put the wrapper dissolve back.** A band holding ONE block inside a column is dissolved; a
  band with a background, height or edge-to-edge setting is kept. Built once and reverted: a block directly in a
  stretched column could not be shrunk (V4 in `resize-leaves-no-gap.spec.ts`)
- `[ ]` **1.1.3 · TASK 3 — outer-edge space when the parent is a COLUMN**, so shrinking opens a space that sticks
- `[ ]` **1.1.4 · TASK 4 — extend `parity-every-arrangement.spec.ts`** to grid cells, components, sticky, floating and
  fixed (neighbours of a floating/fixed block do NOT move; their contents follow every rule), at all breakpoints.
  Today it covers Stack / Side by side / Grid only
- `[?]` **Which list is Tasks 2–4?** A 2026-09-28 session wrote a different one (semantic layer · template feature ·
  template library) and marked it "correct this if different"; never confirmed. The original above is assumed

### 1.2 · The original queue (after the four tasks)

- `[ ]` **"Place here"** + **"Return to original position"** — approved plan
  https://claude.ai/artifact/M5bfZ5NtDiW9oYjZ6NPNqN, nothing built. On release offer "Keep floating" / "Place here"
- `[ ]` "Add a block inside" NESTS each click instead of adding a sibling
- `[ ]` "Side by side" creates an empty row that clicked tiles land AFTER, not inside
- `[ ]` A resize can leave a stale `alignSelf` on old saved pages (may need a migration)

### 1.3 · The roadmap after the layout closes (in this order)

- `[ ]` **Documentation site** — `docs-site/` on Docusaurus, the FIRST thing after the layout closes (RULE DOC)
- `[ ]` **Semantic layer** — decisions A1 · B1 · C1 made; plan https://claude.ai/artifact/21gRsmKjw9RZTgdVbqNMmQ
  - `[ ]` `lang` per page and per block (RULE AF: languages are content)
- `[ ]` **Template feature** — gallery per RULE S; plan artifact for the user's approval first
- `[ ]` **Template library** — one original template per crawled site (~475); `docs/TEMPLATE_LIBRARY_PLAN.md`
- `[ ]` **Components, rebuilt one by one from scratch, every variation** — research first (RULE R); each row of
  `docs/COMPONENT_GAPS.md` is a child of this branch
  - `[~]` Navigation component — plan artifact claude.ai/code/artifact/986a870a-c2e0-43a3-89f3-f7a488be6c5c PARKED by
    the user (2026-09-28: layout only, no component questions during layout work)
  - `[ ]` Hamburger / overlay menu · Forms · Tabs · Steps · Tables · Pricing tables · Breadcrumbs · Pagination · Modal ·
    Logo strip · Tags · Inline links · Theme editor (personality) · Carousel · Calendar · News feed · Staff directory ·
    Map · Downloads · Search · Login panel · Newsletter sign-up · Social row
- `[ ]` **LLM website builder** — v1 deterministic composer → v2 a Claude call emitting the block model → v3 own
  fine-tuned open-weights model (never trained on Claude outputs)
- `[!]` **Builder parity roadmap, Phases 0–9** (memory `project_builder_parity_plan.md`) — Phase 0 done, Phase 1 in
  progress when last recorded; Phases 5–9 need a backend. Reconcile with this tree when the layout closes

## 2 · Risks mitigated by rule (RULE RK — `docs/RISKS.md`)

- `[ ]` **Pilot cohort** — ten real schools (Nigeria and Ghana first), recruited while the components are built
- `[ ]` **Distribution plan** with an owner and a date; the one-hour "show it once" path
- `[ ]` **Demo site** rebuilt from the sweep's own dressed pages, so what is shown is what is measured
- `[ ]` Adoption numbers reported beside the sweep numbers

## 3 · Developing countries first (RULE AF — `docs/DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES_FIRST.md`)

- `[x]` Low-cost phones (Tecno, Infinix, itel, Redmi) in the Preview device list — `bc89d68`
- `[ ]` Weight budget and Slow-3G profile → see 1.1.1
- `[ ]` Offline-first application layer · Paystack / Flutterwave · WhatsApp / SMS · cheap static hosting and local
  domains · second-language versions · templates from the region — each its own area, researched first

## 4 · The rest of Educo (the "original work" to go back to)

- `[ ]` **One engine for the whole of Educo** (RULE APP) — screens migrate to the shared block model and catalogue, one
  area at a time, as components land
- `[!]` **School-admin MVP audit** — punch-list in `docs/MVP_AUDIT.md` (memory `project_mvp_audit.md`)
- `[!]` **Mobile Drive feature** — memory `project_drive_status.md`
- `[ ]` **Builder on phone and tablet** — a webview over the real export, inside the Educo app (rule 20); after the web
  builder is finished
- `[?]` **What exactly is "the original work"?** Confirm with the user which of these it means before returning to it

## Session log

One entry per session, newest first. Written the moment the user says "new session" (or the context is about to run
out) — where the session STARTED FROM, where it GOT TO, and where the next one CONTINUES FROM.

### 2026-09-29 · session df7557b5 · branch `builder/layout-uat` — HANDOVER (the user asked for a new session, to bring the cost down)

- **Started from:** `919d731` with uncommitted work; the tier-99 sweep finished and untriaged.
- **Got to:** three commits pushed — `bc89d68` (the uncommitted work secured), `e4a16f6` (the tier-99 fixes), and the
  handover commit (the last harness fix and this tree). Gate at `e4a16f6`: typecheck 0 · eslint 0 errors · vitest 3,739 ·
  test:fast 640.
  - Tier 99 triaged: 403 pages, 688 min, 52 could not be built, 17 clean — 21 ledger lines (c-1 … c-21).
  - CLOSED, each with a guard that was red first and a headed UAT through the UI: c-1 Icon · c-2 List · c-4 could not
    select · c-5 drop over the toolbar · c-7 holes · c-8 words (harness half) · c-9 image slack · c-10 150% text ·
    c-13 · c-14 · c-15 handles · c-16 (not a bug) · c-17 grid rows · c-18 · c-19 · c-20 toolbar side.
  - 39 sweep pages re-run headed on fixed builds: 35 at 0 errors (the first run had 17 clean of 403).
  - The user's ORIGINAL Tasks 2–4 recovered and recorded (1.1.2 – 1.1.4); this tree created and made a rule.
- **Running when this was written:** the whole tier 99 again, on the fixed build (tree 1.1.1 → tier 99 → d).
- **Continue from:** tree 1.1.1 → tier 99 → d. If the run has finished, triage it and compare with the baseline; if it is
  still running, do nothing to `scripts/uat/` and take c-11, c-12 and c-6 by READING only, or wait.
- **Then, in order:** c-3 · c-6 · c-11 · c-12 → the RULE AF harness (page weight, Slow 3G) → the innovative plan (19 pages)
  → the 19 tier-95 failures → story and artifacts → gate → pull request to `master` → Tasks 2, 3, 4 → the original queue.
- **Decisions waiting on the user (none blocks the work):**
  1. c-7 — a column nobody sized, beside columns that were: keep its share (today), or take what is left of the line?
  2. c-8 — words in a grid cell narrower than the longest word: break the word (today), narrow the grid, or warn?
  3. c-21 — the edge handles cover the last letter of a block that hugs its words: leave, or draw them outside?
  4. a grid of five across is not in the picker (1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 6 · 12): leave, or offer any count up to 12?
  5. which list is Tasks 2–4 — the original (wrapper dissolve · column outer-edge space · parity spec), as assumed?
- **Not done this session, and said so:** the mobile app (`apps/mobile/`) has no canvas, so none of this has a native
  counterpart (rule 20); the published artifacts (Builder Hub, Layout System, Parity Audit) were NOT updated — the guide
  and the story were. They are a line in 1.1.1 and must be done before the pull request.
